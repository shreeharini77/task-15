# AIML Task 15 - End-to-End ML Pipeline

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline using the Breast Cancer dataset.

Steps performed:
- Loaded dataset
- Separated features and target
- Applied preprocessing using ColumnTransformer
- Built ML pipeline using Pipeline
- Trained Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-score
- Saved trained model as .pkl file

This task helped me understand how real-world ML systems are built and deployed.
